## Introduction

Lung cancer detection is a critical application in healthcare. This project uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of lung cancer. Various models are tested to determine their effectiveness in distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous cases.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to lung cancer diagnosis, such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Smoking status
- Number of cigarettes smoked per day
- Duration of smoking
- Family history of lung cancer
- Presence of symptoms (e.g., cough, chest pain, breathlessness)
- Medical imaging features (if applicable)



## Models

The project explores several machine learning algorithms for lung cancer detection, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks

Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.



## Results

The results of the models, including performance metrics and visualizations, are documented in the `results/` directory. This includes confusion matrices, ROC curves, and other relevant plots.



## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/atharva1554/Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML-Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML-Algorithms
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start working with this project, explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. These notebooks include steps for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The `scripts/` directory also contains Python scripts for tasks such as data cleaning and model training.
